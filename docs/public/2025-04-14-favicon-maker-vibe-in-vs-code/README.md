Emojis are more than just tiny icons; they are a universal language of emotion and expression. With the Emoji Grid Generator, you can transform these symbols into stunning visual compositions. Think of it as your personal canvas, where every emoji tells a story, and every background adds depth and character.

## What Can You Do?

- **Discover Randomness**: Each grid cell is filled with a randomly selected emoji from a collection of over 200 unique icons. No two grids are ever the same!
- **Explore Artistic Backgrounds**: Behind every emoji lies a randomly generated background pattern. From soft gradients to psychedelic waves, these designs are crafted to complement the emojis while adding a touch of elegance.
- **Switch Themes**: Toggle between light and dark modes to match your mood or environment.
