# Project Specification: Hollywood Hacking JavaScript REPL Bookmarklet
Date: 2025-04-13

## Project Overview
Develop a bookmarklet that launches a self-contained, Hollywood hacking-inspired JavaScript console overlay on any webpage. The console provides an interactive REPL environment for executing JavaScript commands in real time. It features well-formatted outputs—including syntax-highlighted JSON with collapsible sections and intelligent truncation for very long outputs—combined with essential usability features such as movable, resizable, and minimizable window controls. A "Copy to Clipboard" functionality is integrated into every output entry to facilitate easy sharing. This specification serves as a comprehensive guide to implement the project without additional inquiries.

## User Story: A Day in the Life of Jordan
In the early hours of a busy workday, Jordan, a seasoned web developer, opens a browser to work on an intricate new website prototype. Needing to experiment with JavaScript behaviors and debug complex interactions, Jordan clicks on a specially crafted bookmarklet in the favorites bar. Instantly, a sleek, floating console window with a matrix-green text theme and dark backdrop appears on the screen.

The console is fully interactive—movable, resizable, and minimizable—with a header for dragging, a resizable corner, and a footer for command input. With a few keystrokes, Jordan types a command, executing a `JSON.stringify` on a complex object. The output section transforms the raw JSON into an elegantly formatted, indented display with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections for nested structures.

Delighted with the result, Jordan hovers over the output to reveal a discreet "Copy to Clipboard" button, then clicks it to seamlessly copy the formatted JSON along with a brief on-screen notification confirming the action. When lengthy outputs occur, the console smartly truncates the display after reaching a predefined visual height, using a subtle gradient fade and a "Show More" toggle to expand or contract the content as needed.

In another instance, when an error surfaces due to a mistyped command, the console promptly displays a neatly formatted error message, making troubleshooting straightforward and efficient. Jordan, impressed with the robust error handling, dynamic formatting, and overall polish of the tool, finds that the console not only streamlines debugging but also transforms routine testing sessions into engaging, highly productive workflows.

## Technical Specification

### 1. Functional Requirements

#### 1.1. Bookmarklet Execution
- **Injection:** The bookmarklet launches the console overlay on the current web page without interfering with existing DOM elements.
- **Self-contained:** Must run purely on vanilla JavaScript and CSS without any external libraries.

#### 1.2. REPL Interface
- **Command Input:** Provide a text input area for JavaScript commands with command history navigable via keyboard (e.g., arrow keys).
- **Dynamic Output:** Display results of evaluated commands in a dedicated output area with clear formatting.
- **Error Handling:** Capture errors, display detailed error messages in a distinct and formatted style, and ensure error messages do not disrupt the host page.

#### 1.3. Special Output Formatting
- **Formatted JSON Display:**
  - Auto-detect JSON outputs (e.g., via `JSON.stringify`).
  - Apply syntax highlighting with monospaced fonts and distinct colors for keys, strings, and values.
  - Enable collapsible sections for deeply nested structures.
  - Allow configurable indentation (default is 2 spaces).
- **Generic Output Formatting:** Format all outputs with consistent margins and padding, and preserve whitespace in structured outputs.

#### 1.4. Copy to Clipboard Functionality
- **Button Integration:** Attach a "Copy to Clipboard" button to each output block.
- **Functionality:** On click, the entire formatted output (JSON or plain text) should be copied to the clipboard.
- **Feedback:** Provide a brief visual confirmation (e.g., "Copied!") without disrupting the console experience.

#### 1.5. Intelligent Output Truncation
- **Dynamic Truncation:**
  - Measure rendered output height and truncate only when exceeding a defined visual threshold (e.g., 300 pixels).
  - Use fading gradients at the bottom of truncated areas to indicate additional hidden content.
- **Toggle Control:** Include a "Show More"/"Show Less" toggle to expand or contract the content as desired.
- **User Configurability:** Optionally allow the user to adjust the truncation threshold via an in-console settings panel.

#### 1.6. Window Management
- **Movable and Resizable:** Enable the user to drag the console window and resize it via a draggable corner or edge.
- **Minimizable:** Provide a minimize button that collapses the console into a smaller bar (akin to Windows 3.11 style) positioned at the left side of the screen.
- **Always on Top:** Ensure the console remains atop the web page content to maintain accessibility.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.1. Performance
- **Optimized Rendering:** Efficient DOM manipulation and minimal resource usage.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Utilize techniques like requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations during window resizing, moving, and output toggling.

#### 2.2. Compatibility
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Fully functional in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **Non-Intrusive:** Design to avoid conflicts with existing page scripts and styles.

#### 2.3. Security
- **Sandbox Execution:** Ensure the REPL executes code in a controlled context to minimize interference with page functionality.
- **XSS Mitigation:** Implement safeguards to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

#### 2.4. Usability
- **Intuitive Interface:** Clear, responsive design with logical grouping of actions and commands.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implement common shortcuts for executing commands, navigating command history, and toggling window states.
- **Customization:** Provide settings to allow advanced users to modify aspects like truncation limits and formatting options.

### 3. System Architecture and Design

#### 3.1. Front-End Components
- **Console Container:** A fixed-position HTML element composed of:
  - **Header Bar:** For window dragging and controls (minimize, close).
  - **Body Section:** For formatted output logs, error messages, and outputs.
  - **Footer/Input Area:** For entering commands and handling submission.
- **Control Elements:** Dedicated buttons for window management, output clearing, and copy functionality.

#### 3.2. JavaScript Modules
- **REPL Engine Module:** 
  - Handles parsing, evaluating, and returning results for JavaScript commands.
  - Integrates robust error handling and logs both normal and error outputs.
- **UI Interaction Module:**
  - Manages DOM creation, event binding for drag/resize, and state management (minimized, expanded).
- **Output Rendering Module:**
  - Detects and formats JSON and other outputs.
  - Implements dynamic truncation logic and toggling mechanisms.
  - Integrates "Copy to Clipboard" functionality with appropriate feedback.

#### 3.3. CSS Styling
- **Thematic Design:** 
  - Hollywood-hacking visual style with matrix-inspired green text, dark backgrounds, and monospaced fonts.
  - Custom animations and transitions for interactive elements (minimize, resize, toggle show more/less).
