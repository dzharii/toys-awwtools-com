Bug 01:



![image-20251228161426029](suggestions008.assets/image-20251228161426029.png)



The preview window should open only when I hover over `a` element 



bug 02: the preview window should open on the right side by default, and show more content. it should be dynamically resized to fit the height and width calculating the best width / height and position to **occupy the most of unused empty space**. 



suggestion 03: the preview window should remember it's previous position, but only in memory, so when it opens again, it should open: 

1: same place if the window is visible and still on the user  screen

2: adjust its location to be fully visible if the user scrolled the page, save this new location in memory



bug 04: the design / css colors should match the application style. 



suggestion 005: The preview window should be shown also when I hover over project tree / Navigator. The preview window should also be displayed in the central content panel, even when I hover navigator items. Do not show preview window on folders, only on files. This should use same handling as ToC and should require minimum changes.
