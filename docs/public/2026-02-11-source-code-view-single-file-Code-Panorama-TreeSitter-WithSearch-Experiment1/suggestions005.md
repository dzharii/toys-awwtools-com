1. for every button in the project add context related emoji item, make sure it is well aligned and there is a space between icon and the button text, and the text is properly centered. 
2. The file name appears to be in the middle of the file content, it should be on top
3. Add button to copy file source code fir file path. I should copy in markdown form like



File `styles.css`:
```css
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Make sure to put relative path that you already have and displaying as a file name. The markdown source code language in triple  backticks is simply file extension without a dot or empty. 



The file header and file entry should become Details / Summary section, where I can expand or collapse source code if needed. Make sure that the source code is expanded by default, but there is good UX, clear and visible way to collapse the section.
