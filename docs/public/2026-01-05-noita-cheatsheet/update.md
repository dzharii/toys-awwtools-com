Legend of multi-purpose Noita materials (emoji is fixed per material within this legend), with obvious and non-obvious uses.

💧 **Water**: Core safety tool: self-douse to get the Wet stain that prevents ignition and buys time around fire. Also a purification tool: a little water converts Toxic Sludge into more Water, letting you clean whole pools cheaply. 

🩸 **Blood**: Emergency anti-fire stain (Bloody also prevents ignition) and a combat edge via crit-related interactions on some builds; it is also a common “carrier liquid” for reactions and can be turned into variants (for example by freezing). 

🔥 **Fire**: Terrain and hazard control: spreads through flammables and can be used to ignite oil/peat/wood for area denial, but is also a reaction driver for evaporation and chain reactions. 

🌋 **Lava**: Extreme contact damage and terrain-melting utility; used to destroy/reshape areas (and can generate special “cloud” outcomes when mixed with certain magical liquids). Treat as both weapon and environment tool. 

🧪 **Acid**: High-grade digging and cleanup: dissolves most corrodible materials (notably excluding things like dense rock categories), making it a fast path-maker and a way to delete troublesome terrain. It is also a lethal “contact” hazard rather than a normal stain. 

☠️ **Toxic Sludge**: Early-game attrition hazard that is also a resource: can be purified into Water or Swamp with the right additives, which turns dangerous areas into safe traversal. Its “cannot kill directly via stain” behavior makes it uniquely manageable if you can wash it off. 

🧫 **Poison**: Fast-acting hazard and area denial (liquid plus poison gas on burn/evap); can be washed off similarly to other liquids, and is useful when you want damage-over-time pressure without relying on fire. 

🟣 **Slime**: Superior fire suppression in many situations (often more reliable than water), plus movement control via Slimy slowing. Useful for safely extinguishing burning oil zones and for crowd control by “gumming up” an area. 

🛢️ **Oil**: Utility fuel and mobility modifier: Oiled makes you slippery and more flammable, but immersion still extinguishes fire, creating counterintuitive “panic button” moments. Also used to set controlled burns or trigger explosions. 

🌫️ **Steam**: Common reaction product (water + fire and many other reactions) that can flood spaces and interact with other materials; useful as a “byproduct signal” when you are driving evaporation or metal-vaporizing setups. 

🚬 **Smoke**: Visibility and space-control tool: created by many burns/reactions, can obscure line of sight, and appears as a frequent byproduct in metal and polymorph-related reactions. 

🌬️ **Flammable Gas**: Volatile byproduct you can deliberately create via destructive reactions (notably when strong corrosives or heat-driven reactions occur); it is useful for setting traps but punishes careless ignition. 

⚡ **Concentrated Mana**: One of the best “engineering fluids”: stains grant a strong mana regeneration buff, and the liquid dissolves most metals (turning them into steam), enabling rapid metal-biome excavation and robot-breaking tactics. 

🧿 **Teleportatium**: Mobility, routing, and escape tool: the stain teleports you (often steerable by aim but terrain-dependent), and drinking a small portion yields several seconds of controlled teleports. This is a classic way to bypass threats and reposition through tight spaces. 

🎲 **Unstable Teleportatium**: Higher-risk teleport mobility: teleports are random-direction, so it is less precise but still powerful for “get me out now” moments and chaotic repositioning. It is also a key ingredient in certain “guidance” reactions. 

🧭 **Guiding Powder**: A non-obvious navigation hack: created via Flummoxium + Unstable Teleportatium and produces a pointing firework effect that indicates the direction of the nearest Orb of True Knowledge location, speeding orb routing. 

👻 **Invisiblium**: Stealth liquid: grants invisibility while stained/active, but the effect is disrupted by other stains and certain actions. It is best used with clean movement and careful stain management to slip through dangerous zones. 

🛡️ **Ambrosia**: High-value “invulnerability window” fluid: blocks damage from all sources while active, and is famously used to safely traverse Cursed Rock (parallel-world travel prep) and to survive otherwise lethal situations. 

🏃 **Acceleratium**: Traversal and timing tool: the stain boosts horizontal movement substantially; drinking can give a longer, consistent speed window than surface-staining. Great for risky fetches and fast backtracking. 

🪁 **Levitatium**: Vertical traversal tool: Faster Levitation stain improves climb and airtime efficiency; very strong for reaching hidden ledges, crossing pits, and reducing exposure time in open lines of fire. 

🏎️ **Hastium**: Hybrid mobility buff: improves both horizontal movement and vertical levitation, making it a “single flask solves movement” option when you need speed plus altitude. 

💥 **Berserkium**: Damage amplifier and demolition tool: doubles damage dealt and increases explosion radius from your projectiles, enabling rapid terrain clearing and boss deletion, but can easily self-destruct a run if you misfire. 

💘 **Pheromone**: Faction control and “soft disable”: stains Charmed, flipping many enemies to your side. Non-obvious use: submerging a wand can spawn friendly wand-ghost helpers and interacts with wand-related mechanics people use for utility tricks. 

🪱 **Worm Pheromone**: Worm manipulation: stains apply Worm Food, attracting worms toward the affected location. This can be weaponized if worms exist on the level (it attracts, it does not magically create them). 

🤪 **Flummoxium**: Control-through-chaos: Confused reverses horizontal movement, which can trap enemies against terrain and degrade their accuracy. Non-obvious use: it is part of navigation/alchemy chains (for example guiding powder creation). 

🐑 **Polymorphine**: Extremely dangerous but strategically important: stains apply Polymorph, transforming targets; it is also a key alchemy reagent (for example mixing with Toxic Sludge produces Chaotic Polymorphine). It additionally reacts with Silver (driving a chain that produces Copper and polymorph-related clouds). 

🎭 **Chaotic Polymorphine**: “Anything can happen” transformer: converts creatures into almost any random creature, useful for high-risk escapes, bypassing certain threats, or niche access tricks, but it can also instantly create top-tier enemies. 

🧨 **Shock Powder**: Burst hazard and trap material: made by mixing Brass with Liquid Fire, it burns and electrifies its surroundings, giving you a compact way to create lethal “don’t walk here” zones or trigger electricity setups. 

🧹 **Purifying Powder**: One of the most broadly useful powders: converts many [impure] tagged materials into Water (including several liquids and some powders like mud/wax). Non-obvious: because the powder sinks, purifying floating liquids (like Oil) is mechanically tricky and requires setup. 

🥀 **Diminution**: Offensive debuff fluid: applies Weakness, massively increasing damage taken, so it is a multiplier for almost any damage plan (fire, explosives, projectiles, melee). Use it as a “setup” liquid before committing burst. 

💚 **Lively Concoction**: Regeneration engine: staining can provide sustained rapid healing (stronger in practice than casual drinking patterns), making it one of the best long-run stabilizers when you can secure a pool or safe application method. 

❤️ **Healthium**: High-end healing resource: can provide regeneration via stain similar to Lively Concoction, and is prized because it enables repeatable healing when you can safely apply it without losing the liquid. 

🟦 **Alchemic Precursor**: Seed-specific “goldmaking precursor” made from 3 run-chosen ingredients; its primary strategic value is that it is the required step toward creating Draught of Midas when combined with Meat. 

🏅 **Draught of Midas**: Wealth and conversion tool: turns most solids into Gold on contact and is created by combining Alchemic Precursor with Meat. Non-obvious: using powders with it can “amplify” value because whole piles convert. 

🪙 **Gold**: Currency and material: collected as powder/nuggets and interacts with strong solvents and metal-vaporizing reactions. Also appears as an alchemy endpoint (Midas chain) and can be a component in certain transformations. 

🥈 **Silver**: Multi-purpose metal powder: conducts electricity and is an alchemy pivot for several recipes, including Polymorphine interactions that produce Copper and related clouds; also used in certain quest/structure interactions by players. 

🟫 **Copper**: Conductive metal with notable reaction utility: appears via Silver + Polymorphine chains and can form other metals (like Brass) under specific magical-liquid interactions, making it useful in “I need this metal now” crafting routes. 

🟡 **Brass**: Practical crafting metal: melts under lava/liquid fire conditions, and is directly involved in making Shock Powder. Also combines with Diamond to form Purifying Powder, giving it a “bridge to purification” role. 

💎 **Diamond**: High-leverage powder: valuable less for its own presence and more for what it enables, including producing Purifying Powder, Silver, Ambrosia, and even Void Liquid via alchemical properties. 

🧲 **Metal Dust**: Common conductive powder with a key conversion trick: can be used to turn Flummoxium into Levitatium, acting as a “mobility converter” when you have the wrong flask. 

👁️ **Worm Blood**: One of the best “cleaning” fluids: clears other stains like many liquids but uniquely does so while granting no stain of its own, which is excellent if you rely on Invisibility/Stainless-style gameplay. Also a classic early dark-area utility due to its vision-related effects when used correctly. 

🍄 **Fungus Blood**: Beyond being a slime-adjacent slowing stain source, it is a controlled gateway into Fungal Reality Shifts because consuming it can induce Tripping, which can instigate a shift. Use it when you are deliberately manipulating world materials. 

🧠 **Mystery Fungus**: A subtle long-run tool: remains usable for sustained shifting even if certain fungal materials are shifted out, so it can be leveraged to keep shift attempts available longer than you otherwise could. 

🟩 **Swamp**: Environmental converter: participates in chains that can turn Toxic Sludge into safer liquids and eventually into Peat when exposed to air, letting you “process” dangerous biomes into controllable fuel and terrain. 

🟤 **Mud**: A workhorse intermediate: created from Water + Soil and used to convert Toxic Sludge into Swamp, enabling cheap, scalable purification and biome stabilization. 

🌿 **Peat**: Fuel plus status utility: forms on Swamp exposed to air, is very flammable, and consuming it affects satiation while causing notable gas-related side effects. Useful as both burn material and a deliberate source in reaction chains. 

🧱 **Cement**: Terrain engineering liquid: hardens into Concrete on contact with air/water (faster with water) and chain-solidifies nearby cement, making it excellent for building, sealing, or creating safe platforms and choke points. 

🧂 **Salt**: Mainly a utility ingredient: mixes with Water to create Brine and can be recovered from some Brine behaviors; niche but useful if you are deliberately producing Brine or salt-related setups. 

🌊 **Brine**: Water-adjacent utility liquid: produced from Salt + Water, and is used when you want water-like behavior while participating in salt-related transformations and evaporation outcomes. 

🍋 **Urine**: Rare and surprisingly tactical: provides the Jarated-style debuff effect (players use it for crit-related pressure and to punish enemies), and has niche reaction value; mostly a “secret find” with situational payoff. 

🍺 **Whiskey**: Combat-safety trade: applies Alcoholic (worsens aim), but is also a common alchemy ingredient players use for specific structures/recipes and a flammable liquid for controlled burns. 

🍻 **Beer**: Another alcohol family tool: provides drunk-related effects and can be sourced reliably in specific locations, making it a predictable ingredient when you need an alcohol liquid for reactions or status manipulation. 

❄️ **Freezing Liquid**: Environment control and instant hazard creation: rapidly evaporates into Freezing Vapour and is used to lock down spaces, stop enemies, and create safe pauses by freezing key areas. 

🌀 **Polymorphine Cloud**: A shape-changing hazard in gas form that can be created through polymorphine metal-reaction chains; useful mainly as a warning sign and as part of controlled alchemy rather than direct application. 

🌐 **Teleportatium Cloud**: A mobility-hazard gas form created by specific interactions (notably Teleportatium with Lava, and other niche mixes). Useful as a byproduct marker and occasionally for chaotic traversal plays. 

⚫ **Void Liquid**: Ultra-dense “drilling” liquid: sinks through almost everything due to extreme density and can create dramatic vertical channels; it is also tied to rare creation routes and can self-propagate via certain conversions. Treat it as a controlled demolition and world-shaping tool. 

🦴 **Bone**: Commonly treated as junk until you need it: a key ingredient for creating Diminution via Bone + Vomit, enabling a very strong weakness-based damage plan. 

🤮 **Vomit**: More than a gag material: combines with Bone to create Diminution (Weakness), so it can be an enabling reagent for “everything dies now” strategies when you can apply it safely.
