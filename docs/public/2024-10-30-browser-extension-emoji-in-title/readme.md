**Key Features:**

- **Floating Draggable Button:**
  - A small, movable button appears on every webpage.
  - It is **draggable**, enabling you to position it anywhere within the browser window.
  - The button remains fixed relative to the browser window, so it stays in place even when you scroll.

- **Emoji Selection Dropdown:**
  - Clicking the floating button reveals a dropdown menu containing a list of emojis.
  - The emojis are predefined and include options like "üòÄ", "üöÄ", "üìö", "‚úîÔ∏è", "‚ùå", "üî•", "üí°", and "‚ö†Ô∏è".
  - An additional "No Emoji" option allows you to reset the page title to its original state.

- **Title Modification:**
  - Selecting an emoji prepends it to the page's title, which updates the tab's display in your browser.
  - Only one emoji is allowed per page to keep the tab title clean and readable.
  - If the selected emoji is already present, it won't be added again, preventing duplicates.

- **Persistent Emoji Markers:**
  - The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` to save your emoji selection for each specific page.
  - When you revisit or reload the page, the extension restores the emoji in the title based on your previous selection.
  - The storage key is based on the page's URL (origin and pathname), ensuring that the emoji is associated with that specific page.

- **Easy Reset and Cleanup:**
  - Selecting the "No Emoji" option removes the emoji from the page title.
  - The extension also cleans up by removing the associated data from local storage, leaving no residual data.

**Technical Specifications:**

- **Manifest Version 3 Compliance:**
  - The extension is built following the latest Manifest V3 standards, ensuring better security and performance.

    - `content_script.css` for styling.
  - Functions are well-documented using JSDoc, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

- **User Interface and Experience:**
  - The floating button and dropdown are styled to be unobtrusive yet accessible.
  - High `z-index` values ensure the elements appear above page content.
  - The draggable feature allows personalization of the button's position.

- **Robust Event Handling:**
  - Event listeners are carefully managed to prevent memory leaks.
  - The extension adds and removes event listeners appropriately, ensuring optimal performance.
