  Built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, ensuring a lightweight, easy-to-deploy application that runs entirely on the client side.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The layout is designed to be visually appealing and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. The dashboard will automatically begin updating and displaying the current date and time across all calendar systems.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:**  
  The main HTML file that structures the dashboard layout and includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

- **styles.css:**  
  The CSS file that provides modern, responsive styling and subtle animations for a smooth user experience.

- **script.js:**  
  The JavaScript file that handles real-time updates and contains conversion functions for each calendar system.

## Disclaimer

The calendar conversion algorithms are approximations designed for dashboard display purposes. While they offer a reasonable representation of each calendar system, they may not reflect the complete precision required for detailed astronomical or cultural calculations.
