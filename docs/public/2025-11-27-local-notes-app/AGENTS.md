DIRECTIVES
- Main project specification lives in `spec.md`.
- The TODO list lives in `TODO.md`; treat it as the single source of truth for all work derived from spec.md.
- When starting work, review every category to ensure coverage; add clarifying tasks only if they map back to the spec or new decisions.
- When completing a task, change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` and append ` (Completed YYYY-MM-DD)` to the end of the line, preserving the original Added date.
- If a task is partially done, do not mark it complete; instead, add a short note in a follow-up line beneath it using `  - note:` with status details.
- Keep the structure and ordering of categories intact unless the spec changes; add new categories only when new scope is introduced.
- Any deviations from the spec must be captured as new TODO items or notes with rationale before proceeding.
