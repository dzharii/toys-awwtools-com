- **Rich Content Library**:
  - **Objectives**: 30+ action verbs to define the core task.
  - **Subjects**: 100+ algorithmic concepts covering arrays, strings, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
  - **Contexts**: 50+ diverse scenarios and data structures where the problems are set.
  - **Constraints**: 100+ conditions and rules that add complexity and realism to the challenges.

- **Randomized Constraints**: Includes a variable number of constraints (between 5 and 15) in each problem idea to enhance difficulty and ensure no two problems are the same.

- **Elegant User Interface**:
  - **Minimalistic Design**: Clean and uncluttered layout focusing on the generated problem idea.
  - **Responsive Typography**: Large, readable fonts with aesthetically pleasing color schemes for an enjoyable reading experience.
  - **Smooth Animations**: Subtle fade-in effects enhance the visual appeal without distracting from the content.

- **Instant Accessibility**: Runs locally on your machine without the need for installation or internet connectivity. Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
