## CSS Removal Demo

This project demonstrates the dynamic removal of CSS styles from various HTML elements in real time, using JavaScript. The app is designed to showcase a well-formatted webpage with multiple semantic HTML elements styled with CSS and progressively removes those styles while maintaining functionality.

### How It Works

1. The app initializes by reading the list of HTML elements from the "Elements Used" section.
2. A countdown starts for the first element in the list.
3. When the timer reaches zero:
   - All styles (both inline and CSS rules) are removed from that element type.
   - The process repeats for the next element in the list.
4. Users can observe the visual transformation as styles are progressively removed.

This project is a practical demonstration of manipulating styles dynamically using JavaScript while showcasing the importance of semantic HTML and structured content.
