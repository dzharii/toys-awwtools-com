This project is a small, static web page that shows an animated cassette tape with simple player controls. 

It lets you press play, stop, rewind, and fast-forward to watch the cassette reels and tape move like a real tape player. 

It is meant as a visual, interactive demo you can open in a browser to get a cassette playback experience.
