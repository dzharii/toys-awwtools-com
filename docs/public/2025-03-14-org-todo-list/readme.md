## Full Specification



### To‚ÄëDo List with Org Mode Synchronization ‚Äì Detailed Specification

### 1. Project Overview

**Objective:**
 Develop a single‚Äëpage application (SPA) featuring a dual‚Äëpane interface:

- **Left Pane:** A graphical to‚Äëdo list interface.
- **Right Pane:** A text/code editor that displays and allows editing in Emacs Org mode format.

**Core Technologies:**

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

**Key Requirements:**

- Code must be secure, well‚Äëstructured, and free of bugs, following best practices to avoid vulnerabilities.
- The layout must be responsive‚Äîusing flexible CSS (e.g., media queries) to adapt seamlessly between desktop and mobile views.
- All task data must persist across sessions using the browser‚Äôs local storage.
- An error reporting mechanism‚Äîa screen‚Äëwide notification bar (similar to an Emacs minibuffer) at the bottom of the application‚Äîmust alert users to issues that need resolution.

------

### 2. System Architecture and Design

#### Application Structure

- **Single HTML Page:**
   The application is contained in one HTML file with separate or embedded CSS and JavaScript files to manage styling and functionality.
- **Modular JavaScript:**
   Structure the code into clear modules or functions to separate concerns:
  - **UI Management:** Handling DOM updates, event listeners, and responsive layout adjustments.
  - **Data Model & Synchronization:** Managing the state and ensuring two‚Äëway binding between the to‚Äëdo list and the Org mode editor.
  - **Org Mode Parsing & Rendering:** Converting between the internal data model and Org mode formatted text.
  - **Error Handling & Reporting:** Capturing validation errors, synchronization issues, and local storage errors, then notifying the user via the error notification bar.

#### Two‚ÄëWay Data Binding and Synchronization

- **Immediate Updates:**
  - **UI to Text:** Any action (add, edit, mark complete, delete) on the left pane should immediately update the Org mode text in the right pane.
  - **Text to UI:** Direct modifications in the Org mode text must be parsed and reflected in the left‚Äëpane to‚Äëdo list.
- **Debouncing and Atomicity:**
   Implement debouncing for rapid user input to avoid performance issues and infinite update loops. Ensure that synchronization updates are atomic to prevent partial renders.
- **Conflict Resolution:**
   In cases of rapid, nearly simultaneous changes, implement a ‚Äúlast update wins‚Äù policy or another documented strategy.

#### Data Persistence

- Local Storage:
  - Persist all task data in the browser‚Äôs local storage.
  - On startup, retrieve the stored data and render it in both the to‚Äëdo list and Org mode editor.
  - Handle any local storage errors (e.g., quota exceeded or unavailability) by displaying an appropriate error message in the notification bar.

------

### 3. User Interface & User Experience

#### Layout & Design

##### Dual‚ÄëPane Layout

- Left Pane (To‚ÄëDo List):
  - **Task Display:** Each task displays a title/description, status (pending/completed), deadline and/or scheduled date inputs (with proper validation), optional tags, and notes.
  - **User Controls:** Provide intuitive controls for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, along with toggles for marking tasks as complete or reverting them to pending.
- Right Pane (Org Mode Editor):
  - **Text Editing:** A plain text editor that shows the tasks in Org mode format.
  - **Real-Time Reflection:** Direct text edits update the to‚Äëdo list immediately.
  - **(Optional) Syntax Highlighting:** Basic highlighting for Org mode keywords if feasible.

#### Responsive Design

- **Desktop Layout:**
   Display the two panes side‚Äëby‚Äëside, centered on the screen.
- **Mobile Layout:**
   Adapt the layout‚Äîpotentially stacking the panes vertically (e.g., to‚Äëdo list on top, text editor below)‚Äîto optimize usability on smaller screens.
- **Implementation:**
   Use media queries and flexible grid or flexbox layouts to achieve responsiveness.

### Error Notification Bar

- Position & Style:
  - A persistent, screen‚Äëwide bar located at the bottom.
  - Designed to be noticeable (using a contrasting background color) while matching the overall aesthetic.
- Functionality:
  - Displays error messages related to input validation, Org mode syntax, synchronization issues, and local storage errors.
  - Supports multi‚Äëline messages.
  - Includes a mechanism for auto‚Äëdismissal after errors are resolved or for manual dismissal by the user.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### A. Task Management (Left Pane)

- **Create New Task:**
  - Provide an input field and a button for task creation.
  - Allow users to enter a task title/description.
  - Include additional fields for deadlines and scheduled dates (with proper date format validation).
  - Allow optional tagging (e.g., using a colon‚Äëseparated format like `:work:urgent:`).
  - Permit the inclusion of additional notes or descriptions.
- **Edit Existing Task:**
  - Support inline editing of task details.
  - Ensure that any modification immediately propagates to the Org mode editor.
- **Delete Task:**
  - Provide a delete option (e.g., a button) to remove tasks.
  - Optionally confirm deletions to prevent accidental loss.
- **Toggle Task Status:**
  - Allow users to mark tasks as complete (changing the status to `DONE`) or revert them to pending (status `TODO`).
- **Input Validation and Error Reporting:**
  - Validate inputs (non‚Äëempty titles, correct date formats, etc.).
  - On invalid input, trigger an error message in the notification bar with clear instructions.

### B. Org Mode Editor (Right Pane)

- **Real‚ÄëTime Editing:**
  - Allow direct text editing in the Org mode format.
  - Ensure that changes are immediately synchronized to update the left‚Äëpane to‚Äëdo list.
- **Org Mode Parsing & Rendering:**
   The parser must recognize and support these Org mode features:
  - Task States:
    - `TODO` ‚Äì indicates a pending task.
    - `DONE` ‚Äì indicates a completed task.
  - Deadlines & Scheduled Dates:
    - Parse lines with `DEADLINE: <date>` and `SCHEDULED: <date>` to associate dates with tasks.
  - Hierarchical Structure:
    - Support nested tasks or subtasks using Org mode‚Äôs outline format (asterisks `*` denote levels).
  - Tags:
    - Recognize and parse tags (formatted like `:tag1:tag2:`) attached to tasks.
  - Notes and Descriptions:
    - Allow additional plain‚Äëtext details (indented or inline) to be associated with a task.
  - Optional Timestamps:
    - Optionally support timestamps for task creation or modification if needed.
- **Error Detection in Parsing:**
  - Validate Org mode syntax.
  - On detecting errors (e.g., misformatted lines or invalid dates), display a detailed error message in the notification bar.

### C. Data Synchronization

- Bi‚ÄëDirectional Binding:
  - Changes in either pane must update the underlying data model.
  - Immediately re‚Äërender both panes on any update, ensuring consistency.
- Conflict Resolution:
  - In cases of rapid, nearly simultaneous changes, implement a ‚Äúlast update wins‚Äù policy or another documented strategy.
  - Manage event triggers to avoid infinite update loops.

### D. Data Persistence

- Local Storage Requirement:
  - Save all task data in the browser‚Äôs local storage.
  - On application load, retrieve and render stored data in both the to‚Äëdo list and the Org mode editor.
  - Report any local storage errors (e.g., quota issues) via the error notification bar.

### E. Error Reporting and Handling

- Error Notification Bar:
  - Display validation errors, synchronization issues, parsing errors, and storage errors.
  - Support multi‚Äëline messages.
  - Include options for auto‚Äëdismissal or manual clearing of error messages.

## 6. Implementation Guidance

### Code Organization

- **HTML:**
   Develop a single HTML file that includes the structure for the left pane (to‚Äëdo list), right pane (Org mode editor), and error notification bar.

- **CSS:**
   Use external or embedded CSS with responsive design techniques (media queries, flexbox, or grid layouts) to adapt the UI for various screen sizes.

- JavaScript:

  Organize code into clear modules or functions to handle:

  - **UI Events & DOM Manipulation:** For both panes and the error notification bar.
  - **Data Model Management:** To store, update, and synchronize task data.
  - **Org Mode Parsing & Rendering:** To translate between structured data and Org mode text.
  - **Local Storage Operations:** To save and retrieve data reliably.
  - **Error Handling:** To capture and display errors via the notification bar.

- **Documentation:**
   Include inline comments and external documentation explaining design decisions, particularly for synchronization, debouncing, and conflict resolution.

### User Interaction Flow

- Adding/Editing Tasks (Left Pane):
  1. User creates or edits a task.
  2. The data model is updated and immediately rendered in the Org mode text.
- Direct Text Editing (Right Pane):
  1. User modifies the Org mode text.
  2. The parser processes the changes, updates the data model, and re‚Äërenders the left‚Äëpane to‚Äëdo list.
- Error Handling:
  1. On detecting invalid input, synchronization conflicts, or parsing errors, display an appropriate error message in the notification bar.
  2. The error message remains until resolved or dismissed by the user.
