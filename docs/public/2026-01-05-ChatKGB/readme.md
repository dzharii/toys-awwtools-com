# ChatKGB

ChatKGB is a small interactive web experience that re-imagines a classic text console chat as a fictional Soviet-era interrogation terminal. It is intentionally theatrical: stern phrasing, bureaucratic tension, and retro terminal vibes, presented as a parody.

This is not a political statement or simulation of real-world institutions. It is a humor project built to evoke the mood of vintage computing and dystopian game aesthetics.

## What it is

ChatKGB is a single-page, browser-based console interface where you type short lines and receive stylized responses from a fictional "KGB interrogator" persona. The goal is the atmosphere: an authoritarian-looking terminal, curt prompts, and a playful sense of pressure.

## Why it exists

This project exists to explore:

* how small changes in presentation (visual theme, language tone, framing) can transform the same underlying chat mechanics into a different experience,
* how far you can push "role" and mood using a minimal text interface,
* a compact, shareable art piece you can run locally in a browser.

## How it feels

Expect a retro console aesthetic with strong contrast and Soviet-era visual cues, including the hammer and sickle symbol (☭). The interface is designed to feel like a tense terminal session, but the intent is comedic and performative.

## Inspirations

* Retro terminal computing aesthetics
* Bureaucratic interrogation tropes in fiction
* The mood and framing style of the game *Papers, Please*

## Disclaimer and context

ChatKGB is a work of fiction and a stylized parody. It is not a political project, not a statement of support, and not an attempt to normalize or trivialize real-world harm.

This project borrows the visual language of a "Soviet-era interrogation terminal" as a recognizable piece of dystopian fiction, similar to the way many games and films use authoritarian aesthetics to signal tension and control. The tone is intentionally dark-humor and satirical.

We recognize that the Soviet era involved state violence, repression, and widespread suffering. This project does not deny or minimize those crimes. The intent is to create an unsettling, retro-computing themed art experience that critiques authoritarian tropes through exaggeration and absurdity, not to celebrate them.

If this theme is not something you want to engage with, you should skip this project.

## Credits and lineage

ChatKGB is derived from an ELIZA implementation by Anthony Hay (anthay), which recreates the behavior of Joseph Weizenbaum's 1966 ELIZA/DOCTOR script experience in the browser.
