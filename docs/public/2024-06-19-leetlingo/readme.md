## Flashcards App

Date: 2024-06-19

### Project Overview

The Flashcards App is a web-based application designed to help users memorize common algorithms and data structures for coding interviews. The app uses a flashcard system similar to Anki and Duolingo, providing an engaging and interactive learning experience.

### Features

1. **Flashcards Display**
   - Displays one flashcard at a time with a question and multiple-choice answers, fill-in-the-gap challenges, or matching pairs.
2. **User Interaction**
   - Allows users to select an answer and provides feedback on whether it is correct or not.
3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Tracks the number of correct and incorrect answers.
4. **Hints and Gamification**
   - Provides hints and visual rewards for correct answers.

### Technology Stack

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For app logic and DOM manipulation.

### Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the application.
- `flashcards.js`: JavaScript file containing flashcard data.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file for app logic and DOM manipulation.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Flashcards App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flashcards-app.git
   cd flashcards-app
   ```
   
2. **Open `index.html` in a Browser**
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser to start using the app.

### Adding More Flashcards

To add more flashcards, follow these steps:

1. Open `flashcards.js`.
2. Add new flashcards to the `flashcards` array, following the existing structure. For example:
   ```javascript
   const flashcards = [
       // Existing flashcards
       {
           id: 6,
           type: 'multiple-choice',
           question: 'What is the space complexity of a binary search algorithm?',
           options: ['O(1)', 'O(log n)', 'O(n)'],
           answer: 'O(1)',
           explanation: 'Binary search has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.',
           tags: ['binary search', 'space complexity', 'medium']
       }
       // Add more flashcards here
   ];
   ```

### Contributing
