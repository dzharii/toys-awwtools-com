You are a coding agent working on a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no modules, no bundlers, no dependencies) graphical editor that lets users create subway-map / RPG-skill-tree–style diagrams with circles (nodes), 
straight/diagonal connections, labels, zooming, panning, saving, and exporting; first read `spec.md` for the full technical and functional specification, then read `validation.md` for the manual validation plan that 
defines what functionality must exist and how it will be checked, and finally read `agent-instructions.md` for your implementation and logging/telemetry–focused validation to-do list, 
then update or create the project code so that it fully implements the spec and satisfies all validation and agent-instruction requirements.
