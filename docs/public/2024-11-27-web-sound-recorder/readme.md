Project Specification: Web-Based Sound Recorder

1. Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple web-based sound recorder using native HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The recorder should function locally in modern web browsers, utilizing the Web Audio API for recording functionality. The application does not use any external libraries or frameworks. It should provide a straightforward user interface with essential sound recording features.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1. Recording Functionality

1. Start Recording:

The user clicks a "Start Recording" button to begin recording audio.

The page displays a message: "Recording in Progress".

A timer starts, showing the elapsed recording time in seconds (e.g., 00:12).



2. Stop Recording:

The user clicks a "Stop Recording" button to end the recording.

The recording is saved in memory and displayed in a list of recordings.




2.2. Recordings Management

1. Each recording should be displayed as an entry in a dynamically updated list on the page.


2. Each recording entry must include:

Filename: Format: "Recording [Date] [Time]", e.g., Recording 2024-11-27 14:45:30.

Duration: The total recording time in seconds (e.g., 12 seconds).

Playback Button: A button to play the recording using an inline audio player.

Download Button: A button to download the recording as a .wav file.




2.3. Playback and Download

1. Playback:

Clicking the "Play" button should play the recording directly in the browser using an <audio> element.

Audio playback should not affect other recordings or the ongoing recording process.



2. Download:

Clicking the "Download" button should save the recording locally as a .wav file.

The downloaded file's name must match the recording's filename (e.g., Recording_2024-11-27_14-45-30.wav).

3. User Interface Requirements

3.1. Controls Section

1. Buttons:

A "Start Recording" button to initiate audio recording.

A "Stop Recording" button to end the recording.

The "Stop Recording" button must be disabled by default and enabled only after recording starts.




2. Indicators:

Display "Recording in Progress" when recording starts.

Show a timer counting the elapsed recording time (in seconds) during recording.




3.2. Recordings List Section

1. The recordings list should appear on the right side of the page.


2. Each recording entry should include:

Filename.

Recording duration.

"Play" and "Download" buttons.




3.3. General Design

1. Use simple, clean HTML and CSS for layout and styling.


2. Buttons and labels must be clearly visible and intuitive.


3. Provide visual feedback (e.g., color change or disabled state) for button interactions.
