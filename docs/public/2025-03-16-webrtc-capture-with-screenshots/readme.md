# Final Specification for WebRTC Screen Capture Application

Date: 2025-03-16

This document defines the complete, human-friendly specification for the WebRTC Screen Capture Application. It outlines all the required functionality, design choices, and architectural decisions in clear, concise language. The specification incorporates the original requirements along with all adjustments and improvements made during development, ensuring the application is robust, user-friendly, and maintainable.

------

## 1. Overview

**Objective:**
 Develop a local web application that uses the Screen Capture API to record the content of a window or screen. The application should capture keyframes (screenshots) continuously in two ways: automatically at user-defined intervals and manually upon request. The live screen capture stream, control elements, and captured keyframes must be clearly visible and arranged in a responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

**Key Enhancements & Adjustments:**

- **Responsive Sidebar Toggle:**
   The control panel is housed in a sidebar that can be collapsed or expanded with a toggle button, allowing users to maximize the viewing area when desired.
- **Recording Indicator:**
   A clear, visual “Recording” label is overlaid on the video to inform the user that screen capture is active.
- **API Support Check:**
   Before starting capture, the application checks if the browser supports the Screen Capture API and provides a user-friendly error message if it is unsupported.
- **Robust Error Handling:**
   All errors are displayed in a dedicated error bar at the top of the page (instead of disruptive alert boxes). Non-critical errors can be dismissed by the user, while critical errors (including unhandled exceptions) remain visible.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
   All JavaScript functions include JSDoc-style comments, ensuring that the code is self-explanatory and easy to maintain.

**Reference:**
 This specification builds upon the concepts and examples from the [MDN article on Screen Capture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API/Using_Screen_Capture).

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Screen Capture Functionality

- Capture Mechanism:
  - Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` to request access to capture the screen or a specific window.
  - Display the live captured stream in a `<video>` element.
  - Check for API support at runtime and handle permission prompts and errors gracefully.

### 2.2. Automatic Keyframe Capture

- Periodic Screenshots:
  - Implement a timer (using `setInterval`) that automatically captures a screenshot from the live stream at a user-configurable interval (e.g., 1, 5, or 10 seconds).
  - Capture screenshots by drawing the current video frame on an offscreen `<canvas>`, converting the result to an image, and appending it to the keyframe log.
  - Ensure that the capture does not occur if the video element is not yet ready (e.g., if the video dimensions are not available).

### 2.3. Manual Screenshot Capture

- On-Demand Capture:
  - Provide a button that allows the user to capture a screenshot immediately.
  - The captured image is processed and appended to the keyframe log instantly.

### 2.4. Control Panel and Settings

- Start/Stop Capture:
  - Include buttons to start and stop the screen capture process.
- Frequency Adjustment:
  - Provide a dynamic control (such as a numeric input or slider) that allows the user to adjust the automatic capture interval on the fly.
  - Validate the user’s input to ensure a proper interval is set.
- Responsive Sidebar:
  - Place all control elements (buttons and interval adjustment) inside a sidebar.
  - Include a dedicated toggle button that collapses or expands the sidebar, ensuring that the live capture area can occupy the maximum available screen space on smaller devices.
- Recording State Indicator:
  - Display a prominent “Recording” label over the video stream to inform the user when capture is active.

### 2.5. Error Handling and Logging

- Error Display:
  - All errors are displayed in a dedicated error bar at the top of the page.
  - Use descriptive, human-friendly messages to help users understand what went wrong and how they might resolve the issue.
- User-Dismissable Errors:
  - Non-critical errors can be dismissed by the user via a click action on the error bar once the underlying issue is resolved.
- Critical Errors:
  - Critical errors (including unhandled exceptions and unhandled promise rejections) remain visible until the issue is fixed.
- Global Exception Handling:
  - Implement global error handlers using `window.onerror` and `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', …)` to ensure that all runtime errors are captured and communicated to the user.

------

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Modularity & Maintainability:**
  - The code must be organized into clearly separated modules: one for screen capture, one for managing capture timing and keyframes, one for UI control, and one for error handling.
  - Use ES6 modules and include comprehensive JSDoc-style documentation for each function and module.
- **Performance:**
  - The live video stream and periodic screenshot capturing should operate smoothly without significant browser performance degradation.
  - Optimize DOM updates when appending new screenshots to maintain performance.
- **Browser Compatibility:**
  - Ensure compatibility with all major browsers that support the Screen Capture API (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
  - Provide clear, user-friendly messaging if the API is unsupported or if the user denies the necessary permissions.
- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Screen capture must only begin after explicit user interaction and consent.
  - Clearly indicate to the user when screen capture is active and handle any sensitive content with appropriate caution.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - The layout must adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.
  - The live capture area should always be prioritized, while the control sidebar remains accessible (via a toggle mechanism) on both large and small screens.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1. HTML Structure

- Main Container:
  - Encapsulates the entire application.
- Header/Error Bar:
  - A fixed HTML element at the top of the page that displays error messages.
- Live Capture Area:
  - A `<video>` element that streams the captured screen.
- Control Panel (Sidebar):
  - Contains buttons for starting/stopping capture, manual screenshot capture, interval adjustment, and a toggle for collapsing/expanding the sidebar.
- Keyframe Log Section:
  - A scrollable container where each captured screenshot is displayed sequentially.

### 4.2. CSS Layout & Styling

- Responsive Layout:
  - Use flexible layouts and media queries to ensure the live capture area remains the primary focus on all devices.
  - The sidebar is designed to be collapsible, thereby maximizing the viewing area for the video stream on smaller screens.
- Error Bar Styling:
  - Style the error bar to be prominent yet unobtrusive. It should provide a clear method for dismissing non-critical messages.
- General Styling:
  - Apply a consistent visual design to buttons, inputs, the video element, and the keyframe log.
  - Ensure that the keyframe log container has proper borders, padding, and scrolling behavior for ease of use.

### 4.3. JavaScript Modules

#### 4.3.1. Screen Capture Module

- Functions:
  - **`startCapture(options)`**
     Initiates screen capture by calling `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` and assigns the resulting MediaStream to the `<video>` element. Enables relevant UI controls and displays the recording indicator. Also verifies API support and handles any permission or runtime errors.
  - **`stopCapture()`**
     Stops the active screen capture by terminating all MediaStream tracks, clears the `<video>` element, disables controls, and hides the recording indicator.

#### 4.3.2. Capture Controller Module

- Functions:
  - **`scheduleKeyframeCapture(interval)`**
     Uses `setInterval()` to schedule periodic screenshot captures at a user-defined interval. Clears any previously set interval before establishing a new one.
  - **`captureScreenshot()`**
     Captures the current video frame by drawing it onto a hidden `<canvas>`, converts the canvas content to an image, and appends this image to the keyframe log. Validates that the video element is ready (i.e., has non-zero dimensions) before capturing.

#### 4.3.3. UI Controller Module

- Responsibilities:
  - Bind event handlers for the start/stop capture buttons, manual capture button, capture interval input, and sidebar toggle.
  - Validate user inputs (for example, ensuring the capture interval is a positive number) and update the UI accordingly.
  - Provide immediate visual feedback (like toggling the recording indicator) based on the capture state and user actions.

#### 4.3.4. Error Handling Module

- Responsibilities:
  - Display error messages in the dedicated error bar at the top of the page.
  - Differentiate between dismissable non-critical errors and persistent critical errors.
  - Integrate global error handlers to capture any runtime exceptions or unhandled promise rejections and display them consistently to the user.

## 5. UI/UX Design Considerations

- Content-Centric Layout:
  - The live capture area should dominate the screen, ensuring that the video and captured images are as large and clear as possible.
  - On smaller screens, the control sidebar can be collapsed to maximize the video display area.
- Control Accessibility:
  - All control elements (start/stop, manual capture, frequency adjustment, sidebar toggle) must be easy to see and interact with.
  - The user interface should include smooth transitions and animations (e.g., for collapsing/expanding the sidebar) to improve the overall user experience.
- Error Feedback:
  - Errors are displayed in a clearly visible error bar at the top of the page.
  - Non-critical errors should include a simple dismiss mechanism, while critical errors must be persistent until resolved.
- Visual Feedback for Capture State:
  - A distinct “Recording” indicator is overlaid on the video stream to immediately inform the user when screen capture is in progress.
- Documentation and Maintainability:
  - Every function is documented with JSDoc comments to ensure the codebase is easy to understand and maintain for future developers.
